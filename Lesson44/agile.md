# Agile Methodology

## What is Agile?
**Agile** is a way of working, mainly used in software development, where you build products **step-by-step** instead of delivering everything at once at the end.

It focuses on:
- **Small, fast deliveries** (instead of waiting months or years)
- **Customer feedback** often (not just at the end)
- **Team collaboration** and flexibility (changing plans if needed)

Agile is **like building a house room-by-room**, showing each finished room to the owner, and adjusting based on their feedback — instead of building the whole house and showing it only when it's fully done.

## Why Agile?
Traditional methods (like "Waterfall") planned everything at the start. If something changed later, it was expensive and painful.

Agile solves this by:
- Allowing **changes** during the project
- **Reducing risk** by delivering small parts early
- **Making customers happy** by showing results quickly

## Key Principles of Agile
There are 4 **core values** (from the Agile Manifesto):
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

**In short:** Agile prefers people, real results, customer involvement, and being flexible.

## How Agile Works (Simplified Steps)

1. **Divide the big work into smaller parts.**  
   (These are called **User Stories** or **Tasks**.)

2. **Work in short cycles called Sprints** (usually 1-4 weeks).  
   After each Sprint, you have a small, working part of the project.

3. **Review and get feedback** after each Sprint.

4. **Adjust plans** based on feedback and what you learned.

5. **Repeat** until the project is complete.

## Agile in Action: An Example
Imagine you are building a food delivery app.

- In Sprint 1 (2 weeks): Build "Login Page" + "User Profile."
- Sprint 2: Build "Restaurant List" + "Search Function."
- Sprint 3: Build "Order Process" + "Payment System."

After each Sprint, you show the app to real users and improve it based on their feedback.

Instead of waiting 1 year to launch everything, you have something **usable and testable** every few weeks.

## Popular Agile Frameworks
Agile is a mindset. There are different **frameworks** (ways to organize the work), like:
- **Scrum** (the most popular, uses Sprints, Daily Stand-ups)
- **Kanban** (visualizes tasks on boards, focuses on continuous flow)
- **XP (Extreme Programming)** (good for technical practices)

**Scrum** is the most common starting point for teams learning Agile.

---

## Key Agile Roles (especially in Scrum)
- **Project Owner** = The person resposponsible for delivering the complete project.
- **Product Owner** = The person who knows what the customer wants.
- **Scrum Master** = The person who helps the team follow Agile rules.
- **Development Team** = The people who build the product.

---

## Important Agile Terms
- **Sprint**: Short time box (1-4 weeks) to deliver a usable product part
- **Backlog**: List of all things to build
- **Daily Stand-up**: Quick 15-minute daily meeting to sync up
- **Retrospective**: After each Sprint, discuss what went well and what to improve

---

## Key Mindset in Agile
- **Done is better than perfect.**
- **Expect and embrace change.**
- **Deliver early and often.**
- **Listen to users continuously.**

---

## ✅ Summary
> Agile is about **building products step-by-step**, **getting feedback early**, and **adjusting quickly**. It’s about **collaboration, flexibility, and fast results**.
